# Distributed Systems & Computing


## Distributed Systems

- A distributed system is a coputing environment in which multiple independent machines , often referred to as nodes or hosts , work together to achieve a common goal.

```In a distributed system , a 'cluster' refers to a group of interconnected nodes, such as computer or servers, that work together to perform a common task or service.These nodes communicate with each other to share and distribute computing resources, data and workload terby imporving performacne , fault tolerance and scalibility.```

```Clusters are commonly used in various distributed computing environments , including databases,web servers and big data processing systems.```

### Distributed Computing
- Distributed computing refers to the use of distributed systems to complete computing task.

### Software Architecture of Distributed system

- Layered architecture
- Object-based architecture
- Data-Centered architecture
- Event-based architecture

### System Architecture of Distributed system

- client server architecture
- peer-to-peer architecture


### Features of Distributed systems 

- concurrency
    - handle multiple task or processes at same time.
- scalability
- fault tolerance
- distributed file systems
    - these systems allow the storage and retrieval of file across multiple nodes in a distributed manner.
    - Example: Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and Google File System(GFS)
- distributed Databases
    - In distributed databases,data is distributed across mutiple nodes and the database management system coordinates access and queries.
    - Example Apache Cassandra,Amazon DynamoDB
