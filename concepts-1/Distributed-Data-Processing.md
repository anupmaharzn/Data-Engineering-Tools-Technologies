# Distributed Data Processsing

### Data processing
- Data processing is the collection and manipulation of digital data to produce meaningful information.

- Data processing may involve various processess
    - validation
        - Ensuring that supplied data is correct and relevent
    - sorting
        - arranging items
    - summarization
        - reducing detailed data to its main points
    - aggregation
        - combining multiple pieces of data
    - analysis
        - interpretation and presenation of data
    - reporting
        - list detail or summary data or computed information
    - classification
        - seperation of data into various categories

### Distributed Data Processing

- Distributed data processing refers to the use of multiple computing resources,often spread across different locations, to analyze and process large volumes of data.
- The goal of distributed data processing is to divide the workload among multiple nodes or machines, enabling parallel processing and faster data analysis.

- key concepts and componenets related to distributed data processing
    - distributed file systems
        - google file system and hadoop distributed file system
    - MapReduce
        - programming model used for processing and generating large datasets in a parallel and distributed fashion.It is commonly associated with the Hadoop framework.
    - distributed database
        - database that store and manage data across multiple nodes.
    - cluster computing
        - this involves the use of clusters of computer to work together as a single system.
